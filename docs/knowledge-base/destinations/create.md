# Creating Destinations

This guide shows you how to create new destinations in Coolify for deploying your applications and databases.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a destination, ensure you have:

- At least one server connected to Coolify
- Appropriate permissions to manage destinations
- Basic understanding of Docker networks

## Creating a New Destination

### Method 1: From Destinations Page

1. Navigate to **Destinations** in the main navigation
2. Click the **+ Add** button
3. Fill in the destination details:
   - **Server**: Select the target server
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for the destination
   - **Network**: Docker network name (auto-generated)

### Method 2: From Server Management

1. Go to **Servers** and select your server
2. Navigate to the **Destinations** tab
3. Click **+ Add Destination**
4. Configure the destination settings

## Configuration Options

### Destination Name

- Must be unique per server
- Auto-generated based on server name and network ID
- Can be customized to be more descriptive
- Format: `server-name-network-id`

### Network Name

- Automatically generated unique identifier
- Uses CUID2 format for uniqueness
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Used as the actual Docker network name

### Server Selection

- Choose from available servers in your team
- Server must be online and accessible
- Determines where the Docker network will be created

### Destination Type

The destination type is **automatically determined** based on your selected server's configuration:

#### Standalone Docker

- **Automatically selected** when the server is configured as a standalone Docker host
- Creates a standard Docker network
- Suitable for single-server deployments
- Supports bridge and custom networks

#### Docker Swarm

- **Automatically selected** when the server is configured as a Docker Swarm manager or worker
- Creates overlay networks for multi-node communication
- Server must have Docker Swarm mode enabled during server setup
- Advanced feature for clustered deployments

::: tip Server Configuration Determines Type
You cannot manually choose between Standalone Docker and Docker Swarm when creating a destination. The type is determined by how your server was configured when it was added to Coolify.
:::

## Configuring Server Type

To use Docker Swarm destinations, you must configure your server as a Swarm manager or worker when adding it to Coolify:

1. **Adding a new server**: During server setup, check "Is it a Swarm Manager?" or "Is it a Swarm Worker?"
2. **Existing servers**: Server type cannot be changed after creation - you must add a new server with the correct Swarm configuration

## Automatic Network Creation

When you create a destination, Coolify automatically:

1. **Creates the Docker network** on the target server
2. **Connects the proxy** (Traefik/Caddy) to the network
3. **Configures network settings** for proper isolation
4. **Enables inter-container communication** within the network

## Network Scanning

You can also scan existing Docker networks on a server and add them as destinations:

1. Go to **Server** â†’ **Destinations**
2. Click **Scan Networks**
3. Select existing networks to import
4. Coolify will create destination entries for them

## Validation and Errors

Common errors when creating destinations:

- **Network already exists**: The network name conflicts with an existing one
- **Server unavailable**: The target server is offline or unreachable
- **Permission denied**: Insufficient Docker permissions on the server
- **Invalid network name**: Network name contains invalid characters

## After Creation

Once created, your destination will:

- Appear in the destinations list
- Be available for deploying applications and databases
- Have network connectivity configured automatically
- Be ready to host your containerized resources
