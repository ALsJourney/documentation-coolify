### Basic Information

- **Name**: Update the destination display name
- **Server IP**: View the server IP address where the destination is hosted (read-only)
- **Docker Network**: View the Docker network name (read-only)

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names for destinations
2. **Resource Organization**: Group related applications in the same destination
3. **Monitoring**: Regularly check destination health and resource usage
4. **Documentation**: Document purpose and configuration of each destination
5. **Cleanup**: Remove unused destinations to reduce server load
