## What is Bitcoin Core

A self-hosted Bitcoin Core full node.

## Public Node vs. Private Use

By default, Coolify’s Bitcoin Core service is configured for private/internal use. This means it is intended for connecting wallets or apps from the same server or private network, and **does not accept inbound P2P connections from the public internet**. This is a security-conscious default to help reduce the attack surface, especially for new users.

### How to Run a Public Node

If you want your Bitcoin node to be a fully public peer (accepting inbound connections from other nodes):

1. **Expose the P2P port in your Compose file:**  
   Add the following under your `bitcoin-core` service:   
    ```text
    ports:
    - "8333:8333"
    ```

2. **Open port 8333 in your server’s firewall:**  
- On Ubuntu with UFW:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 8333/tcp
  ```
- On CentOS with firewalld:
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8333/tcp --permanent
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```
- For cloud servers, update your provider’s security group or firewall rules to allow inbound TCP on port 8333.

### Considerations

- **Default Behavior:**  
Without the `ports` section, your node will not accept inbound P2P connections, but can still make outbound connections and fully sync the blockchain.
- **Security:**  
Not exposing 8333 by default helps protect users who may not understand the implications of running a public Bitcoin node.
- **Advanced Users:**  
If you understand the risks and want to contribute more fully to the Bitcoin network, follow the steps above to run a public node.
