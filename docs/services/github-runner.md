## What is GitHub Runner?

GitHub Runner is a self-hosted runner for GitHub Actions that allows you to run CI/CD workflows on your own infrastructure. This Docker-based solution provides more control over the execution environment, better security for private repositories, and can be more cost-effective for heavy workloads. It supports running workflows for multiple repositories and organizations.
