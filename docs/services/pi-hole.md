## What is Pi-hole?

Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole, protecting your devices from unwanted content without installing client-side software. It blocks ads, trackers, and malware at the network level by filtering DNS requests. Pi-hole provides detailed analytics about your network's DNS queries and can significantly improve browsing speed by blocking unwanted content before it reaches your devices.
