## What is Sequin?

Sequin is the fastest Postgres change data capture (CDC) solution that helps you sync data from your PostgreSQL database to other systems in real-time. It captures database changes and streams them to various destinations, making it perfect for building event-driven architectures, maintaining data consistency across services, and creating real-time analytics pipelines.
