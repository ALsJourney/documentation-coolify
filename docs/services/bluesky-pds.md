## What is Bluesky PDS?

Bluesky PDS (Personal Data Server) is a self-hosted server that stores your data for the Bluesky social network. It allows you to control your own social media data and identity while still participating in the broader Bluesky network. The PDS handles user accounts, posts, followers, and other social data in a decentralized manner.
