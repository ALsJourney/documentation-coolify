## What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a free and open-source distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is commonly used for log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and click stream analytics use cases.
