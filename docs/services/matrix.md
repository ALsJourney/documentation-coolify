## What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open-source, decentralized communication protocol that enables secure, real-time communication. It provides end-to-end encrypted messaging, voice and video calls, file sharing, and room-based conversations. Matrix serves as an excellent alternative to proprietary platforms like Slack or Discord, offering federation capabilities that allow different Matrix servers to communicate with each other.
