## What is KaraKeep?

KaraKeep is a self-hostable bookmark-everything app with AI-based automatic tagging. It serves as a comprehensive read-it-later service and alternative to Pocket or Omnivore. KaraKeep can automatically categorize and tag your saved content using AI, making it easy to organize and rediscover articles, videos, and other web content you want to save for later.
